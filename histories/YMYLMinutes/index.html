The book is in possession of Joseph F. Buchanan, West Jordan, Utah. This presentation shows some digital images of pages and the front cover and contains a number of the pages of minutes transcribed from the book. The work will be completed over time, as I am able to complete the work.<p>One of the purposes of this work is so that those people who descended from the members of this young men and young ladies group may enjoy seeing what their ancestors did in their mutual activities.<p>You can see the actual pages by clicking --><a href="viewer.html">here</a>.<p>Here is a <a href="../../images/OakCityChoir.jpg">picture</a> of the Oak City Choir, taken at about this same time. There are quite a few of the people identified in the minutes that are also in this picture. The director, Eddy Q. Dutson, is also mentioned once in the minutes.<hr>Here is a transcription of pages 1-16 of the minutes:<p>(Minutes start on February 15th, 1903)<p>Oak City Feb 15th 1903<br>The young Men's Mutual met with the young ladies conjointly for devotional exercises.<br>First counselor Lee Anderson in charge.<br>Choir sang - Lo the Mighty God appering etc.<br>Prayer was offered by Jesse Anderson<br>Choir sang - Come, Come ye Saints.<br>young ladies marched unto the adjoining room<br>Roll was called and minutes of last meeting read and approved.<br>The subject before the class was - Practical Religion (continued)<br>1st.
