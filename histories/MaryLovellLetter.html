<h4>The 1877 Mary Fry Lovell letter to John Lovell</h4>
In 1877, John Lovell's sister-in-law, Mary Fry Lovell wrote a letter to John to ask for help in resolving a probate dispute with her late husband Edmund Lovell's estate. It appears that Edmund Lovell abandoned his wife and two children in England and went to Texas. There he married another woman and left a will designating his family in England to receive part of his estate upon his death. The will was written with the specific instructions that it was not to be opened and read until after his death. It appears that only his executor, C. H. Kendall, knew of his wife and children in England. In the process of working out the details of the will, the executor died and his brother, W. E. Kendall was to finish the process and get the money and proceeds from the sale of the property to Mary and her family in England. The widow in Texas also died during these years. From the details of the letter, it seems that the money was used to plant a crop of cotton and, according to Mary, the people in Texas did not seem to be inclined to honor the conditions of the will. Mary asked John to go or to send his sons to Texas, or at least to make inquiries so that they might be inclined to resolve the issue in favor of Mary and her family in England.<p>
This letter gives us some details about the family that were previously unknown.<p>
Below the letter are some details found in research which corroborates and expands on the information found in the letter.<p>
Following is the body of the letter (original spelling and punctuation unchanged):<p>

<p>In doing a little research, it was discovered that E. G. Lovell is listed in the 1860 Census for Fort Bend County Texas with a wife Mary Lovell. His age is listed as 42, which matches the age of Edmund Lovell. He is listed as E G Lovall and his wife Mary Lovall. They are both from England. She is 40 years of age at the time of the census.<br>
The marriage of Edmund is shown as taking place on 26 Apr. 1856 in Galveston, Texas and his wife's name is Mary Painter.<p>
Back in England, an interesting note is found in the <a href="../images/sources/England/1851CensusFry.jpg">1851 Census record</a> for Mary Fry Lovell and her family. She is living with her aged parents at the time of the census. She is listed as being 34 years of age and her "Rank, Profession or Occupation" is listed as: "Pauper, Husband Emigrated." Her four children (two from a marriage before her marriage to Edmund Lovell) are John Nipper age 12, Elizabeth Nipper age 10, Sylvia Lovell age 5 (she was really almost 7), and Amelia Lovell age 4. From this, it is evident that Edmund left England somewhere between 1847 and 1851.</td></tr>
