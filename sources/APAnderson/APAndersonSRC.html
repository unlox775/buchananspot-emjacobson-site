Oak City Pioneer Passes Away<p>
Peter Anderson passed away April 9, at the home of his son J. Lee Anderson, in Oak City. Born Dec. 10, 1847 at Svendstrup, Denmark, he emigrated with his parents Jens Anderson and Anna Pederson leaving Copenhagen Dec. 22, 1853, and arriving in Salt Lake Oct. 4, 1854.<br>
Brigham Young sent them to Fillmore, as they needed a wagon maker there, and Jens was a wheelwright by trade. They made the trip with By Bartholomew, and built a frame house east of Fillmore under the hill in the old fort. The father died in 1855, leaving the mother with Peter, Christian and Joseph S. a babe three weeks old. They were the only Scandinavian family in the county and unable to speak the English language.<br>
Bishop Louis Brunson, the Lovells, Carlings and others were very kind to the young widow and in 1857 she married John Lovell. Five children were born to them. The family moved to Deseret then to Oak City in the fall of 1868 where they have since resided.<br>
Peter as a boy helped build the Old Deseret Fort and stood guard with Nicholas Paul and others for two years. In 1870 he was elected secretary and manager of the Coop store and in 1872 he married Martha Lovell in the Endowment House in Salt Lake. Their surviving children are Edwin, J. Lee, Alice Jacobson, Agnes Lyman, Delilah Jacobson, Geo. and Elmer.<br>
In 1882 he married Annie Lyman and their surviving children are: Ely Nielson, Lucy Walker, Eldon, Don, F. Ellis and Ethelyn Bennett.<br>
Mr. Anderson served as Bishop of the Oak City ward from 1880 to 1907. He was ordained Patriarch in 1914.<br>
His wives both died several years ago.<br>
Funeral services were held Monday April 11, and were in charge of Bishop Willis E. Dutson. The speakers were Alonzo Robison of Fillmore, Willis E. Robson and John Reeves of Hinckley, John Styler of Oasis, Patriarch Samuel W. Western of Deseret, Edwin Lovell of Ririe, Idaho, and Edward Leo Lyman of the Stake Presidency.<br>
Mrs. Hazel Trimbo sang a solo, and his granddaughter, Nina Anderson gave a sketch of his life.
