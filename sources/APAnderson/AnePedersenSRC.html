Millard County Chronicle, 12 August 1920, page 1.<br>
Oak City's Oldest Citizen Passes On.<p>
Funeral services were held July 30th for Mrs. Ann Lovell, who died July 28, at the home of her son, John E. Lovell, where she has been confined to her room for eight years.<br>
The funeral was largely attended. The speakers were Anthony Stephenson and John Hunter of Holden, Jos. T. Finlinson of Leamington, Abel M. Roper and Jos. L Anderson of this place, who spoke of her noble character and a well spent life.<br>
Music was furnished by a mixed quartette.<br>
The deceased was born in Denmark, March 18, 1824. She emigrated to this country with her former husband, Mr. Anderson, who died in Fillmore soon after they arrived here. She later married John Lovell Sr., and came here in 1868, being among the first to settle here.
She was the mother of nine children, four of whom survive. They are Peter and Jos. S. Anderson, and John E. and Brigham Lovell, all of this place.
Her descendants numbered two hundred and sixty-six.<br>

Location: Oak City, Millard, Utah, USA<br>

Note: The stone lists all of her children, implying that they were all children of her with John Lovell. The first three children are children of Jens Andersen. Also, this stone erroneously lists her birth date as 18 March 1824, instead of the correct date of 8 March 1824.<br>
