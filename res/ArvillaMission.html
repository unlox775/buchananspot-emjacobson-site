They called a photographer and took our pictures.<br>We rode with Elder Johnson to Gonzales (?).  There we had a wonderful conference but I certainly felt like I would easily have gone through the floor.  I played for the singing and played too fast then played for Elder Cauk (?) a violin solo.  We both got lost then they called me up to talk right after that.  I was so upset and scared I made a mess of everything.  I hope I may be forgiven.  I must learn to do better.<br>I talked to Bro.

I had charge of two songs by the children & a Diologue with 3.  They went off pretty well.  When the program was over I looked back and there was a man who lives on our tracting Dis.  He offered to bring us home so we accepted and he practically insisted on us going to lunch, but I refused.  He called and took us to night meeting.  He acts so queer.  I had to talk so I studied most of the afternoon that is when I could keep my mind on anything.  The man worried me.  The Baptist church had a broadcast of carols from 6 to 8 on the steps of the city hall.  We missionaries with Sr. Doty & Cook & Black decided to go to midnight mass so in order to kill time we got on the ferry and rode back & forth twice.  It was so cold I nearly froze.  Then we went to mass at 11 so we could get a seat.  It was all very interesting.  The music was beautiful.  The priest gave about a 30 min. talk.  Of the things he said, that the saying should be peace on earth to men of God will not as we say it and there are many things we are not to understand just believe.<br>The Elders came over about 11 last night to use the phone as they were called to go to a distant city to administer to a sick lady.  So we decided to hold a class just we missionaries.  We did & made plans to hold them in the future.<p>Monday Christmas<br>We were invited out to Sr. Penningtons for dinner so before going I swept & dusted the floors & washed the dishes.  We were late getting there.  I was ready in plenty of time we had roast Turkey, chicken & pork dressing with each & all the trimmings with 4 kinds of pie & 3 cake.  We visited & played games then went to Sr. Westbrook for supper.  Sis got sick so much excitement.  Sr. Millet brought us home.<p>Tuesday Dec 26.<br>We had a terrible rain storm in the night and we went tracting.  It was still raining a little but we put out 3 hours in anyway.<br>We went out to Sis. Blackburn's for dinner.  I received a lot of cards today Uncle Alfred& Ivan Shipley each sent $ & the seventy quorum sent a 5 money order.<br>I got a letter from Pres.  He wonders why we don't have more hours investigator when so many saints.<p>Dec 27.<br>I am so thrilled today I sold my first B of M.  The man was the only one home he invited us in and we talked quite a while on gospel subjects.  I told him about the book and he said he would like to read it.  He asked if there were any charges on it.  I said when we sold them they were 50 cents so he paid me and said he would read it carefully.  He looks like a good prospect.  Also the little lady that has my book says she reads a little each morning and finds it very interesting.  This morning at one of my first houses my tongue got twisted when I tried to talk to a man.  I couldn't say Latter Day Saints.  I said "rattle day snakes".

Then I got the bright idea to take the Elder to a show so called him to see if he wanted to come to my Birthday party.  He did so we went to see "Four Sous".  He paid the tickets but I'll get him.  He walked home from the bus with us.<p>My Birthday-1940.<br>Being Sat.  I washed my hair and we just got the washing on the line to bring it in as usual but it charred so we could take it out again.   I wrote my letter first for a change.  I received a nice letter from Lorna and a birthday care from Mrs. Savage.   Theis afternoon I went and had my picture taken he is doing it 3 doz for $5 pretty expensive but the least I can do, I guess.  Hope they turn out OK.  Came home wrote to folks and did regular work.<p>Sunday Aug 4.<br>Fast Day.<br>I had the Primary class to myself.  4 were present and really got along fine.<br>I fixed $1.20 in the reports to give to Elder Bailey. Don't know what he will say when he receives it.   We are at the picadilly again, spent the afternoon at home, visited the Priesthood class really enjoyed it.  Sister Doty, Sis & Bro. Millett took up the time in meeting.  Rode home with Bro. Brian and Elder Bailey handed him the reports as we got out of the car.<p>Monday.<br>I was tracting this morning tho I did loan one Book.  We went out to Sis. Blackburn's for dinner met her sister Mr. and Mrs. Jacobson.  They are very nice and brought us home.  We went up to see my pictures, chose 2.  Then we went out to see Sis. Lanory.  Ate sandwiches and milk and pop until I couldn't hold any more.  Received som handkerchiefs from Lorna.<p>Tuesday Aug 6.<br>A high gale but we went out anyway for 2 hrs.  We went to see Mrs. Browning her husband makes such a fuss we can't hold class any more with her.  She is really sorry.  It stormed and rained so much we couldn't go to Mrs. Sheltons so called her.  But we did get out to Kleinpeters tried the new method asking questions wasn't so good tonight because they hadn't all read.  They brought us home and brought us a treat.<p>Wed.<br>Steady downpour all day, so we didn't hold classes. Went to see Zylks, had supper with them.<p>Thursday Aug 8.<br>A hard rail all morning but we did go to Mrs. Shelton's then to Mrs. Cooper's but she wasn't home so we bought some things for the Box Supper.  Sis. Got her county paper and it has a picture of Mr. Knowlton, he is running for Attorney General.  Seems good to see his picture. We visited this afternoon Millets, Ficklins, and Mr. Kleinpeter brought us home.<p>Friday Aug. 9<br>More rain so I washed my hair.  We both got our money so went to town to get them cashed the Elders came to see us, caught us as usual.  We shopped for dresses, Sis. got one.<br>Well, we had our Box Supper.  It really went off fine considering the crowd.  And we cleared $32.  Sis. Brian had a large cake made it had writing on top, saying "It is better to give than to Receive, Give to the Lord".  They bought is and then gave it to us.  And Sis. Kleinpeter gave us some punch.  So the Elders are coming over to help us eat it.  Glad it's over.<p>Sat.<br>Slept late this morning.  Didn't have any soap so went to town before doing the washing.  I got my pictures was quite disappointed in them.  The Elders came for their cake and they each took a picture.<p>Sunday Aug 11.<br>Went we arrived at S.S. Bro. Black informed us that he hadn't planned to talk and Sis. talked last time so it was my turn.  So I had to come home and study.  I talked on Revelation. Guess I didn't do so bad.  Bro. Bradford and Black followed us to the Picadilly  for dinner.  The Zylks were to S.S. so Glen played the organ.<p>Monday.<br>We put in 3 hrs. this morning then this afternoon decided to go see Hanson Fiklin's mother so started walking a man stopped in a car asked us if we wanted to ride.  He looked harmless and we had a long way to go so we got in. Walked back to Baton Rouge and caught the bus.<br>We had just been home a few minutes when the Elders came they ate cake and stayed over an hour.  Mrs. Saurage can't seem to see why we don't go out with them.<p>Tuesday Aug 13.<br>We had a fine day a good morning tracting and I loaned a book.  Mrs. Shelton's friend was there again we had a good class and also a good one at Kleinpeter's.  They took us out and over the new bridge it is surely pretty at night.<p>Wed.<br>Sis has her monthly visitor so we didn't tract.  Held our meetings I bought my hat.  We went to Sis. Brian's to give her her part - hoping Elder Bailey wouldn't be there by the was.  After visiting there we went to the other Brian's and had supper.  Leslie brought us home.<p>Thursday 15.<br>We started tracting this morning with other things on our minds.  Mrs. Saurage hopped onto us about using too much water again.   We certainly didn't accomplish much while tracting so we started looking for a house.  We spent the afternoon out at Dixon's quilting on a quilt she has made for our Relief Society Bazaar.  I only got 7 blocks finished by was tired.<br>Just before noon we went to Sis. Millets to give her her part for the program coming Wed. Night.  She told us of the things the Westbrook's had to say about us behind our backs.  That didn't add much to our joy.<br>Our Lexianians came so we had to read them before going to bed.<p>Friday.<br>We decided we would try evening tracting today so all together put in 6 hours.  It is so terribly hot.  We can hardly take it.  We went to see if we could find Mrs. Petty after we found her phone had been disconnected and found she is in New Orleans in the Charity Hospital such a long walk in the heat.  As long as we were that far we went to see Mrs. Shaw.  She invited us to stay for supper but we thought it best not to.  We rested a little but then went over to Scenic Highway where we have never found anyone home in the mornings.  Sis had two fine conversations at one place we were invited in and she loaned a B.M. We went over to Barman's for a little while.<p>Sat.<br>As usual its time to go o bed and my eyes hurt and I don't have my letters written.<br>We had our washing done and the room cleaned nice but it was all messed up and the Elders dropped in and wasted about an hour.  They said we would hold street meeting so we hurried to get up town.  I purchased a purse (black).  Elder Miller talked for the first time, did fine.<p>Sunday Aug. 18.<br>Sunday again, had quite a small crowd Wilma was there to help me and Br Millett asked her to take the class. She was quite happy about it.  Also Br. Zylks was assigned to take Br. Black's place.  We and Br. Black spent the afternoon at Rowland's.  Met most of their family.  Elder Miller talked tonight.  He did fine. Sis got out of it after worrying about it all day.<p>Monday.<p>Tuesday.<br>We tracted in the forenoon after we paid the rent and had a discussion about it then my party arrived so I laid on the bed until about 3:30 went to Van Osdell's to take their picture as promised and she had supper cooked for us the best chicken I believe I have tasted since I've been here.  We intended to stop a Pennington's but didn't have time had our class at Kleinpeters.  And had to walk home cause the Mr. was working.  Sis. Blackburn was operated on this morning at the Lady of the Lake.<p>Wed. 21<br>A big day the Elders came over and hindered us a bit. Had a pretty good morning went to invite Mrs. Pennington and Katherine to Relief Society, are invited to their house for Woodrow's birthday dinner Sat.  Rushed to Fullers then to the hospital to see Sis. Blackburn then to Mrs. Easley's home then out to Relief Society meeting. Had a good crowd more than we expected.<p>Thursday 22.<br>Br. Marchand called up and told us Sis. Marchand was being operated on so this afternoon we went up to see her both she and Sis. Blackburn are doing fine.  The elders had not been around and Marchand wanted them to administer to her so he took us and we went to their place but they weren't home.  He brought us home but we turned around and went back up town to go to the show but there was such a crowd we didn't wait.<p>Friday.<br>We put in 6 hrs. tracting I loaned a book to the woman that lives at Zylks.  We arranged a meeting with Mrs. Law.  A cousin of Sis. Millet.  While we were wating for the bus to go to the hospital Mrs. Ames came along and took us all the way.  Then Br. Marchand took us to town so we went to the show.  The Return of Frank Jones.  Pretty good.  Sis. Marchand can go home in the morning and also Sis. Blackburn.<p>Sat. 24.<br>We went to Woodrow Pennington's birthday dinner the 3 Elders were there.  They all like my smiling picture best.<br>Received a card from Melba.  She has been M.I.A. supervisor for 6 months.  We went to town I bought me some black suede shoes $5.05 so now I have a complete outfit except gloves.<p>Sunday Aug 25.<br>Wilma taught the little class so I went in the Gospel Doctrine.  It so happened that the 3 Elders, Zylks, Wilma and we were all on the same bus going home, and for a little while we were the only ones on the bus.  We went to Penningtons to finish the remains of the Birthday dinner.  When we got home I felt pretty sick, but managed to get through the day.<br>P.S. I felt so sick so we went right to bed the Elders came for their quilt about 10.  Had to get them in the dark.<p>Monday<br>We put in 6 hrs tracting we each loaned a Book.  I got a letter from Elder Crane with some pictures.  Then Elder Nelson gave us orders to be to street meeting so we got there by 5 no Elders.  We waited 45 minutes still no Elders so we went out to Penningtons pretty put out and tired.  We attended their class.  Elder Bailey took chrage and he didn't construct the class the way he told us to.  They (Penningtons) brought us home after giving us all an ice cream cone.  Gave Elder Bailey some aspirin to see if they would dry his sores.<p>Tuesday 27.<br>Terribly hot tracting this morning we went to Sis Millet's for shrimp gumbo dinner a ate and drank too much.  Walked out to see Sis. Blackburn, she is feeling pretty good by things are worse for her.  We're going to do more tracting but got waylaid at Kleinpeters so stayed there had a good class, believe the question method is best.  Sis. Brian was at Blackburns she said Elder Bailey received a telegram saying to have conference Sunday night.  So......So.<p>Wed.<br>Picked up a book but didn't loan one.  Met a man who has been to Utah and really thinks a lot of it, especially the construction of the tabernacle.  Had a fine class with Mrs. Easley.  We went to a Methodist Revival meeting with Mrs. Saurage.  They paid their visiting evangelist $25.00 and tonight was the last night they baptized 5 new members.  Such a great contrast from our Church service. A lady that Sis. had loaned a B.M. to was there and asked her to bring it back cause her husband wanted to read it.<p>Aug 29 & 30<br>Thursday we held our first class with Mrs. Laws came home and went to see Sis Lanory's, she wasn't home.  Friday, tracted 5 hrs. again today rushed home and got ready to meet the train from Lake Charles for the Sis. Missionaried and Elders but they weren't on it.  All the missionaries in but them.<p>Sat. 31st Aug.<br>Missionary meeting at 9. Pres didn't get here held meeting until 1.  Took Sis. Lewis and Burtokoffer to the Picadilly for lunch then home to rest and get ready for a ball game and watermelon bust with Elders.  Sure had an enjoyable time.<p>Sunday Sept. 1<br>At Sunday school mostly missionaries. After we with Elers March and Romney and Sis. Missionaries went to the capitol.  We were pretty tired and of course had seen it before, but enjoyed our visit.  Went home to rest up and I started looking through my things and reminiscing we had a grand meeting tonight.  Each conference I enjoy so much more.  Everyone could feel the Spirit of God there.  Had a grand time meeting all the people from Gonzales, Albany, and Pride.  We went with Lake Charles missionaries to Depot and treated them to ice cream.  Sis and I made a bet with Elder Bailey of $5 that he will be married in less than 2 years are to collect in October conference 1942.  That's when I get a new hat.  Rode home with Penningtons.<p>Monday Labor Day.<br>Tried tracting but no one home, then we did see Mrs. Rounsville and had a better conversation than we have ever had.  We went to see Sis. Blackburn's, I'm afraid there is going to be the break things are no better.  Came back and visited Mrs. Cook for a while then to Sir. Pennington's attended the Elder's B.M. class.  Again they assigned me a chapter to give out of clear blue sky.<p>Tuesday Sept 3.<br>Mr. And Mrs. Pennington baptized.<br>We held our class with Mrs. Shelton a little early so we could get to Istmuna by 3.  Witnessed the baptism and confirmation.  We and Elder Bailey went to Dixon's for supper.  When we came back he, Elder paid our way to a show which wasn't very good and he slipped out and went home.  When we got home we found a box from home with peaches, pears, plums, and apples.  Quite a few peaches were spoiled, it has been so hot but we didn't waste any that was good.  We made quite a picture sitting on the floor without our dresses eating until about 11 p.m.<p>Wed. Sept 4.<br>I think we held our last class with Mrs. Fuller today. We have decided we aren't making any progress with her.  We purchased the wallet for Elder Bailey.  Hope he likes it.  The Elders told us to be at street meeting so we didn't hold class with Mrs. Easley.  Got there and waited and no elders so went home just got here when Br. Pennington came along so we all went to the show "The Sea Hawk" a celebration for Elder Bailey going home.<p>Thursday.<br>Only could tract 2 hrs.  Elder Nelson had made arrangements to hold Mrs. Coopers class at 11:15 so we had to get there he conducted she told us she had quit her coffee and cigarettes.  I sure hope she can keep it up.  Sure had a good class with Mrs. Law.  Also with Kleinpeters.<p>Friday 6.<br>Say Elder Bailey off we went to see Mrs. Barman until train time. Elder Bailey hated to leave but no tears.  Sure hate to see him go.  A very fine D.P. We got up early and put our wash out.  Held our class with Mrs. Easley, then spent the evening getting ready to go to New Orleans. Wilma came over to sleep.<p>Sat. 7.<br>Alarm went off at 4 am we caught the first bus and got at the Depot just in time for the 5:40 train.  Arrived in N.O. at 7:40 called the Elders then went to find some breakfast.  The Elders came at 10:00 then we started out to see the city first to Audibon park.<br>The Street cars run so fast I nearly took spills several times and it takes an hour to get anywhere.  We went around to see the aristocratic homes.  The French section and to the market.  Took some pictures by the old slave block.  It was 3 and we hadn't eaten so we went in search of something then down to the River and docks took some pictures and decided to cross on the ferry.  The Elders gave us tickets by the time and got back to town we were to late to get in the stores so no souvenirs.  We went out to Lake Portchristian (?) Enjoyed seeing the people enjoy the entertainment.  I forgot we went to the Cabildo and St. Louis church but were too tired to enjoy standing around to look.  We couldn't locate Sis Miltonburger so Elder Goobritch took us to a place they stayed once and there we got a nice large room for 50 cents apiece.  Sure felt good to have a hot bath our feet were about worn out.  And so to bed.<p>Sunday Sept. 8<br>The street cars woke us we decided to take our bags to the Depot to check it so got a taxi then started for Sunday School the street car conductor said it only about 2 blocks so we started walking and sorta got lost and walked 3 extra blocks.  I was resting easy when they asked me to teach the Primary class then when they reassembled they called on Sis and I to say a few words mine were a very few.  I was sure glad to see Sr. Saxon and the other 2.  I took their picture after S.S.  We bid the Elders adieu then went in search of a dinner ate at the Holsane(?pg126) cafeteria then back to the depot to come home.  Got here just as Bro Rupert and Nichols wife Sis Saxon arrived.  Sis. Saxon claims me as her daughter.  They took up the time. Bid Bro Bradford and Black goodbye.<p>Sis Averett arrived in Baton Rouge Sat Sept 28.  And Sis Little left 30th at 12 midnight.  That night however we three went with the Elders to Pride to a Revival meeting with the assurance that we wouldn't have to talk but Sis. Little and I did.<br>Goodbye Sis. Little, see you 1941.<br>Sis Verett and I begin looking for a new place to live.  Elder Smith came as our new D.P.  We decided to tract north Highlands, but couldn't find a home there so after a 4 day search we finally with the aid of the Elders and Sis. Porterfield we located on Eighth St. With Mrs. Herne.  She seems very nice.  Moved Monday Oct 7.<p>Tuesday Oct 8.<br>We decided to stay home and unpack we went out to Sis. Blackburn's ate sandwiches had a long talk with her. We had to hurry to get to Mrs. Shelton's then we were late.  We met the Elders for street meeting but didn't hold it so purchased some shoes and stockings and came home.  No supper I studying.<p>Wed Oct 9.<br>We went with Elders to hold St. Meeting then out to their meeting at Brown's.  I enjoyed the meeting very much and also enjoyed the trip home.  A secret - we wore the Elder's coats to the bus case it was cold.  Had a real chat with Elder N. about Shelton's and the Mason lodge.<p>Sat.<br>Thot we would go to Grant's Fire Sale but couldn't even get a look in purchased a hat and shirt.

We live in town now so we aren't offered rides anymore.<p>Monday.<br>The day of Brigham Young Show.  And I received the grandest letters from my parents.  Father has been ill with a lame back and says he enjoyed the excuse to stay in to listen to the Radio and hear all the conference.  He seems so happy about my mission.  Mother and Carol went to Salt Lake to conference.  We went to see the show.  It was fine only I didn't like it to show Pres. Young doubting.  After the show we met Bro. and Sis. Marchand and Reno and Wife and others from Gonzales.<p>Tuesday Oct. 15.<br>I feet very humble tonight.  I have been assigned another responsibility - to act as Y.W.M.I.A. Pres. to start the M.I.A. here with Elder Nelson.  With that and the Relief Society and new primary besides all the rest I truly need to be humble and trust in the Lord for guidance and pray that I may be found worthy.  Elder Smith called to our room to see us at noon and had a fine chat.<br>Received a card from Sis. Little yesterday she is in Logan looking for work.<br>Sheltons went to the show last night, she liked it a lot but he didn't it is my continual prayer that he may be lead to see the truth. We went and had supper at Barman's.  I am going to have my friend make Friendship Blocks for me.<p>Dec. 2. 1940.<br>A lot has happened since I last wrote.  In the first part of Nov. Elder Miller was transferred to Morgan City and Elder Linsey came.  We had conference on the 21 and 22 Pres was sick and Apostle Callis came instead of Bowers.<br>And Sat. Night while we were out to Millet Elder Nelson came in to say good bye.  Is and I were the only ones at the Depot to see him off a 12:10 midnight.  From all reports I think he kinda likes me and I hated to see him go.  Have a lost feeling.  Maybe. Oh well.???<p>Dec. 8 Sunday.<br>We went to spend the day yesterday with Sis. Parker then last night we went out to Sis. Blackburn's and made candy.  We looked at Jupiter and Saturn and the moon through a telescope.  Bro. B. was quite nice tho things just aren't the same.  He brought us to the Bus.<br>Today I had the worry of talking on my mind so I couldn't enjoy my stay at Dixon's very much.  There were four speakers tonight. Sis and I, Elder Hanson (new Elder) and Bro. Zylks.  We are working on another program for the Relief Society for the 22nd.<br>When we went to hold our meeting with Mrs. Shelton she shocked us by saying they are moving to Alexandra for 16 months so I probably will never see her again.<p>Monday Dec. 9.<br>Elder Lindsey called up said we would have to talk over some mutual business so they came about 10:30.  I had told him had a bone to pick so he asked me.  We couldn't talk very well in front of Sis and Elder Hanson so E. L. told them to go out and sit on the porch so they went (which they shouldn't) and we had a talk hither and yon.  I guess I was sorta down in the dumps anyway.  I got a few things cleared up.<br>I was fasting cause I have felt I needed added strength to overcome Satan.  I feel I have been slipping this afternoon we went to see a lady I left a B.M. with a long time ago.  Had a grand talk with her.  Mrs. Alexander arranged for Bible class Wed.  Didn't hold class with S. Pennington.  Went to see Brother Sweet.<p>Tuesday.<br>The Elder called up again and they came over again with a lot of work for us to do.  I think I shall be going around in circles.  Sis woke up dizzy and sick.  Had dinner at Pennington's held primary and class at Kleinpeters.  They took us to see some Submarine at the Miss.<p>6:30 a.m. Dec 19 Elder Smith called from the Depot announcing he had a new companion for me.  Sis. Lora Lee Huff.  from Salt Lake City.  And Sis. Averett left at 11:12 same morning.<p>It's now Jan 26, '41<br>Just got home from a most enjoyable conference. We went to New Orleans yesterday morning with Herberts.  We held missionary meeting then Pres. made me very happy, he paid me some very high compliments before the whole group and best of all he said he may keep me another 6 months.  We went to the Gold and Green dance, every one had such a grand time, but I went home to Bro and Sis Evans with such a sick head achefelt better this morning went to Sunday School in a terrible rain, but had a good meeting.  Pres. was here and organized a district board for the S.S. and Relief Society.<br>And joy of joys, Baton Rouge was organized as a Branch tonight also mutual.
