Receive the Seal as the blessing from thy Father, and I seal thee up to come forth in the morning of the first resurrection and receive thy crown even an Eternal crown in the Mansions of thy Father, even so, Amen and Amen.<p>=======================================<p>529<br>    3<br>----<br>1587 words @ .4. 163<p>[Transcribed Feb/Mar 2000 by <a href="http://www.cc.utah.edu/~joseph/">Joseph F.
