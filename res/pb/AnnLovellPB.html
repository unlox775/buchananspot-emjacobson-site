Remember my daughter thy prayers in the season thereof in behalf of thy absent friends and relatives and the Lord will give them thee and thou shalt rejoice in their society in the land of America, the principles of faith shall rest upon thy mind and by thy prayer of faith disease shall be rebuked when preying upon the systems of thy children, let thy mind and thy affections be given to comfort and console thy partner and thy house shall be a house of order, the Spirit of the Lord will abide with thee and thou shalt have dreams and visions upon thy bed to comfort and console thy mind, the desires of thy heart shall be given thee to gather with the Saints, there thou shalt rejoice upon thy inheritance, there thy influence shall be extended in building Temples to the Lord, for thou shalt be blest with the gift to make clothing for those who labor upon it even on the Temple of the Most High, there thou shalt receive the fulness of thine enduement and be exalted and share in the blessings of thy exaltation in common with thy partner. Remember the seal of thy Father for thou hast in thy veins the blood of the Ancients that wore the seal of promise and I seal thee up to enjoy the blessings of Eternal lives in the Kingdon of thy God. Amen and Amen.<p>==================================<p>[Transcribed Feb/Mar 2000 by <a href="http://www.cc.utah.edu/~joseph/">Joseph F. Buchanan</a>]</body></html>
