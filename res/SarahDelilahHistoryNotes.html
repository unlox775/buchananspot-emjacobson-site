The following information was found on some life history forms. The forms have a printed date on 1960 on them. It is likely that Arvilla asked Delilah these questions and recorded her comments on this form. Some of the information is in her words, sometimes she is refered to in third person. Sometimes there were just random comments on the page.<p>

<h4>The following are some memories of my mother and father:</h4>
My father was quite an even tempered man. I never saw him lose his templer and become angry. He was a very religious man. Leader in community.<br>
He spent a lot of time at his mine; he had high hopes that he would find valuable ore. He'd come home week-ends for supplies. Homesteaded large acreages north of town, both dry land and irrigated. He had horses and cattle.<br>
He was bishop all through my childhood. We used to pay tithing in chickens. The three girls would carry live chickens up to Geo. Finlinson's for the tithing - also paid in potatoes, other vegetables and fruit, eggs.<br>
My mother was a homemaker. She was tied down at home with a large family, so didn't go out much. She was quite a heavy woman and very motherly looking.<br>
Stake officers would come and stay at the bishop's home. The family would make room for 2 or 3 men and their horses. She cooked for them and made them comfortable while the boys tended the horses and wagons, an excellent cook. She made salt-rising bread that was loved by everyone. Famous for her rice puddings and sweet cakes. Carded wool, made quilts, made extra good soap.<p>

<h4>Membership in the Church</h4>

Thrifty, careful family<br>

Went to school in church house. Didn't graduate but went thru 8th grade. Didn't have H. S. in those days. Jos. Finlinson and some older ones went to S. L. or Provo to go to school.<br>
Lucy and I were in same crowds. Eldon and Geo. can't remember Lucy much before school. Don and Elmer didn't feel like they were. Used to feel a bit jealous of Lucy. When I had a toothache I had to go have it pulled. We had to scrimp and save. Lucy said she was going to ask Pa.<p>

Hair Parted in middle, hanging straight, sometimes a braid on each side fastened together in back with a ribbon. The other hair hanging straight under the braid.<p>

"Have had a good life but not very eventful. I guess our life has been fun & we've got a lot out of it even if it wasn't eventful."<p>

Having May party in the canyon probably May party. Somebody's team ran into our wagon (hit tongue of wagon) and tipped it over. The children & mother were in the wagon. I got a bloody nose. I remember Hanna Rawlinson wiping blood off my face.<p>

Lucy & I were riding with Geo. & Eldon coming down canyon road. Horses got scared of something & started to run. Lucy & I jumped out along Jack Hill. The horses ran part way thru town before being stopped.
