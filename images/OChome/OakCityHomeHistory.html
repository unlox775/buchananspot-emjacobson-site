<html><body bgcolor=white><h4>The Old Oak City Home</h4>A history of Oak City was written, "Shadows of the Past," published by the Oak Creek Camp of the Daughters of Utah Pioneers. In it, on page 89, it says:<p><cite>"In 1868 Peter Anderson, a young unmarried man, came to help settle Oak City. He was assigned lot 3 in Block 7 in the new settlement. The first log schoolhouse was erected on Lot 3. Adjoining Peter's lot 4, a new schoolhouse, a store, and a church were built.<br>"Peter married Martha Ann Lovell on April 14, 1873. he built a three-room adobe home for her on the north half of lots 3 and 4. With lumber sawed by him in the sawmill he partly owned, he built the interior of the house."</cite><p>The deed to the property is dated 14 July 1871, signed by Edward partridge, and states that Peter Anderson is the owner of "West 1/3 of Lot 3 in Block 7 Plat A Oak City Survey," the ownership being made "in consideration of the sum of One 18/100 Dollars." (The deed document is in possession of Joseph Buchanan.)<p>Subsequent deeds show that on the 21st of July 1919, the property (1 and 1/4 acre) was transferred from Martha A. Anderson to Peter Anderson,  and on the 22nd of July 1919 it was transferred from Peter Anderson to Delilah Jacobson. It is interesting to note that Martha Ann died on July 27, 1919.<p>There is a Quit Claim Deed dated 4 December 1936 for the property in the name of Delilah Jacobson. Peter Anderson died on 9 Apr. 1932. <br> On 27 March 1964, the property was deeded to Forrest Buchanan and Arvilla J. Buchanan.<p>The property was sold to the LDS Church to give expanded property for use of a parking lot for the church. The house was torn down in 1972.</body></html>
